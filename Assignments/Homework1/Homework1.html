<h3>Problem 1</h3>
</header>

<div class="w3-padding w3-light-blue w3-display-container">
<h4>Distributed processing and organization of the brain (30 points)</h4>
<p class="w3-opacity">
    Begin by fully enjoying and admiring the artistry in writing, film, and animation in 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q6qHRHTTPg" target="_blank">this clip</a>.
    Now, at the beginning of this clip the knights are skeptical of Donkey's neural development 
    of Broca's and Wernicke's areas as current research suggests that those areas have homologues 
    within animals of the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62797" target="_blank">non-human
    primate variety (macaques)</a> and not donkeys. Identify with both timestamps and explanations at 
    least one situational example in which somebeing (other than the old lady as she knows he's simply 
    refusing to talk) suspects that Donkey's brain is devoid of a Broca's area homologue <b>and</b> an 
    example of a Wernicke's area homologue. (There are multiple within this clip).<br><br>

    E.g., The knights at the beginning (from about 35 seconds) clearly do not believe Donkey understands 
    what the lady is saying nor that he is capable of speech generation which puts into doubt whether or 
    not he has homologues of those areas. (In your answer be more specific of which brain area homologue
    and why you believe it to be the case. This is just a quick simple example that should not be used 
    as it is given).

<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ol class="w3-opacity">
    <li>Clear understanding of the functionalities of Broca's <b>and</b> Wernicke's areas (15 points)</li>
    <li>Creativity and critical thinking. There are multiple examples within this video that can be 
        argued for as diagnoses of Donkey either having problems with his homologues of these two brain
        regions or the lack of their existence within his brain, however, it requires understanding of 
        functionality along with creativity to make these arguments. (14 points)</li>
    <li>Sense of humor (2 points)</li>
