            This is a matrix of raw data recorded from a tetrode (a four channel electrode) in the hippocampus
            of a long evans rat --- he was a good boy. The sampling rate is 30 kHz, and the data are simultaneous 
            voltage signals (in $\mu$V) from each channel. I (Dr. Kemere) considered having you do the spike extraction
            for this data --- this involves the steps we (Shay & students in 483/548) discussed in class (1) filtering
            out LFP into spike band (600 Hz 2 pole highpass and 2 pole 6 kHz low pass) and (2) finding instances where
            one of the channels crosses a threshold. For the sake of time, I, Dr. Caleb Tilo Kemere, decided to do this
            for you. Additoinally, for the sake of understanding, I, Shayok "Shay" Dutta, BS, MS, decided to explore the
            data for you and provided it within a shared notebook provided in a link shared before. Each snippet is 40 
            sampples long, and the threshold crossing happens between the 10th and 11th samples in this data. I, Dr. Kemere,
            chose a value of 60 $\mu$V for the threshold which Shay reverse discovers in the shared notebook because he chose 
            to jump into exploring the data without reading the instructions (cuz like let's be real who actually would 
            read instructions as opposed to hopping in?).

    <h4>Plot the spike peaks in 4-D space (10 points)</h4>
    <p class="w3-opacity">
       Find the peak amplitude (post-threshold) of each snippet on each channel. If you look at some waveforms, youll see that the peak typically happens
       within 5-10ish data points of the threshold crossing (later peaks are noise!). Search for peaks that are between sample 5 and sample 25. If you are
       new to <code>NumPy</code>, the function <code>np.argmax()</code> is a a good place to start! 
       <br><br>
       Make a 6 subplot figure showing a point in each panel for each detected action potential. The point should be the peak amplitude on channel A vs the 
       peak amplitude on channel B, where A and B are the combinational pairs within {1; 2; 3; 4} (i.e., 1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, 1 vs 4, etc.). Once you've found the
       snippet peaks as a list or numpy array, the code below can be useful. Please not that there is also code provided within the notebook link shared earlier
       that plots this differently (and more aesthetically in Shay's opinion). Remember to make sure plots are labeled and understandable.

    welcome to check your answers with the implemented version that is available. Use your implementation to determine the neuron responsible for each recorded 
    spike. Use only the data from the first channel of the tetrode. You may also use basic <code>NumPy</code> commands, i.e., linear algebra and functions that
    you would find on a graphing calculator. Treat each snippet as a point in $\textbf{x}_m\in\mathbb{R}^D,m\in\{1,2,...M\}$, where $D$ is 40, the length of each snippet, 
    and M is the total number of snippets. In this problem, we will assume there are $K=3$ neurons contributing spikes to the recorded waveform. For computational

        <h4>Clustering using Pearson Correlation (50 points)</h4>
        <p class="w3-opacity">
            This problem replicates a result from the paper "Sub-second dynamics of theta-gamma coupling in hippocampal CA1"
            by <u><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44320" target="_blank">Zhang et al. eLife 2019</a></u>. They calculated
            the spectrograms of the LFP data and extracted individual theta cycles. They then clustered these spectrograms to 
            assess whether higher frequency gamma oscillations preferentially occur at certain phases of theta.<br><br>
    <h5>Data Description</h5>
        <p class="w3-opacity">
            The data for this problem can be found <u><a href="https://elec548.github.io/Assignments/hw4problem5.npy" target="_blank">
            here</a></u> and loaded as:

            <pre class = 'w3-opacity'><code id="python_code3">import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.load('hw4problem5.npy')
plt.imshow(data[0,:,:])</code></pre>

        <p class="w3-opacity">
            The data you are given are a series of matrices of size $K \times N_{\theta}$ where $K$ is 81 and $N_{\theta}$, the number of
            phase bins is 20. The phase goes from $-\pi$ to $\pi$ (i.e., <code>phase = np.linspace(-np.pi,np.pi,20)</code>), and the 
            frequency vector can be calculated as <code>freqs = np.arange(20,182,2)[::-1]</code>. Note that in the frequency vector
            and the data, the 0-th entry corresponds to the highest frequency (180 Hz). This is so that plotting with <code>plt.imshow()</code>
            works nicely.
            <br><br>
            Recall from lecture how I made fun of my <u><a href="http://arielfeldman.github.io" target="_">former mentee</a></u> for messing up the distance
            formula. In this paper they use a distance measure derived from the Pearson correlation, specifically $d(x,y)=1-\rho(x,y)$.
            As shown in <u><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6739991">this paper</a></u>, clustering with Pearson 
            correlation distance is equivalent to using K-Means on normalized data, $\tilde{x}=\frac{x-\tilde{x}}{\sigma_x}$, where $\tilde{x}$ is the mean of 
            the data point $x$ (across its dimensions) and $\sigma_x$ is its standard deviation.
            <br><br>
            To cluster, you can use your K-means implementation or the scikit-learn one. Assuming you've created a matrix of <code>normdata</code>, which is 
            normalized properly, here's some example code that works.
            <pre class = 'w3-opacity'><code id="python_code4">from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
K = 4
ndata = np.reshape(normdata, \
(normdata.shape[0], normdata.shape[1] * normdata.shape[2]))

.fit(ndata)

cluster0 = np.reshape(\

                    Find 3 data points (i.e., theta cycles) which are close to the centroid of each cluster and plot them. How similar do individual 
                    cycles look to the averages?

                <li><span>
                    Find 3 data points which are close to the boundaries of two or more of the different clusters. (You can do this by finding the
                    distances to each cluster center, and sorting the data points by how close they are!). Plot these examples. Give a qualitative
                    description.
