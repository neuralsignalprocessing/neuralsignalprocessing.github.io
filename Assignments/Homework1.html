<h4>Distributed processing and organization of the brain (30 points)</h4>
<p class="w3-opacity">
    Begin by fully enjoying and admiring the artistry in writing, film, and animation in 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q6qHRHTTPg" target="_blank">this clip</a>.
    Now, at the beginning of this clip the knights are skeptical of Donkey's neural development 
    of Broca's and Wernicke's areas as current research suggests that those areas have homologues 
    within animals of the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62797" target="_blank">non-human
    primate variety (macaques)</a> and not donkeys. Identify with both timestamps and explanations at 
    least one situational example in which somebeing (other than the old lady as she knows he's simply 
    refusing to talk) suspects that Donkey's brain is devoid of a Broca's area homologue <b>and</b> an 
    example of somebeing suspecting Donkey is devoid of a Wernicke's area homologue with similar timestamp
    and explanation. (There are multiple within this clip).<br><br>

    E.g., The knights at the beginning (from about 35 seconds) clearly do not believe Donkey understands 
    what the lady is saying nor that he is capable of speech generation which puts into doubt whether or 
    not he has homologues of those areas. (In your answer be more specific of which brain area homologue
    and why you believe it to be the case. This is just a quick simple example that should not be used 
    as it is given).

<h3>Problem 2</h3>

<h4>Membrane potentials, Nernst Equation, & GHK (50 points)</h4>
<p class="w3-opacity">
    Refer to PNS Chapter 7 for an explanation of the Nernst and Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz equations. As discussed
    in lecture 4 on 9/6/22, a neuron's resting potential is determined by the relative intra- and extra-cellular
    ion concentrations and the corresponding conductivities of the respective ion channels. For a permeable
    membrane, if an equilibrium is established (i.e., by active transport) in which the concentration of an
    ion is different on either side but net passive flow of ions in and out is zero, an electrical potential
    (a voltage) will exist which represents the point at which the force of diffusion is balanced by electostatic
    forces. The Nernst equation gives the voltage as a function of the inside and outside concentrations.

    Use the following constants...
    <ul class="w3-opacity">
        <li><span>
            R = 8.31
        </span></li>

              When the membrane is permeable to multiple ions, the equilibrium that is established is similar, 
              with the relative permeability for each ion determining its impact on the final membrane potential
              in addition to its external and internal concentrations. The Goldmann equation (or GHK) gives the
              equilbrium potential as a function of concentrations and relative permeabilities.

        <li><span>
            Taking into account the potassium, sodium, and chloride concentrations, calculate the resting
            potential of a neuron with the characteristics in the table above.
        <br><br></span></li>
        <li><span>
            How could you adjust the potassium level to raise the resting potential? Why does this work?
        <br><br></span></li>
        <li><span>
            Calculate the new extracellular potassium concentration that would be needed to bring the resting
            membrane potential to -65 mV. To counteract the change in potassium concentration, the cell could
            insert or remove ion channels into the membrane thus changing the permiability ratios. Specifically,
            which ion channels would you propose the cell insert or remove in order to recover the original
            resting membrane potential? Calculate the new permeability ratios given your proposed change.
        <br><br></span></li>
        <li><span>
            It has been shown that there is an increase in extracellular potassium concentration within the rat
            hippocampus following concussive brain injury model. In general would the resting potential 
            of a neuron in this region be higher or lower given this change? What might this change do for a neurons 
            ability to fire an action potential assuming the threshold to required do so remains constant?
            <br><br>
            (BONUS)
            A common test for human concussion diagnoses during sports is eye tracking of an object and noticing the 
            rate/speed of eye movement in the tracking. Typically, the tracking is slower in individuals who have
            recently experienced a concussion. This implies that the assumptions made earlier
            are probably not safe to make in practice. One may hypothesize that it may take more time for a 
            neuron to reach the threshold to fire action potentials regardless of the resting potential, thus, impairing an 
            indivdual's eye tracking abilities. What change within the neuron may lead to this change? In other words, how 
            may the extracellular concentration of potassium have changed? Use the topics we've discussed in lectures and 
            reference PNS or Google Scholar as needed (but cite references outside of PNS).

    <h4>GHK equation with divalent ions (35 points)</h4>
    <h5>...aka mild derivation torture :P</h5>
    <p class="w3-opacity">
        The ion channels which are active at the cell's resting potential ("resting channels") are in real-life
        fairly selective and not particularly permeable to ions other than sodium and potassium, and in particular
        not to divalent ions. However, in the Kingdom of Far Far Away near where problem 1 takes place, it follows that 
        this may not be the case. Let's say, as I'm sure the knights in the land of Fiona's parents are aware of unlike the knights
        of Lord Farqaad in his sole rule of Duloc, that the resting neural mebranes are also permeable to manganese. Further, let's assume intra- and
        extracellular concentrations are identical to the table above.

<h4>Action Potentials & Synapses (20 points)</h4>

    <blockquote><p class="w3-opacity">
        Classically, dendrites have been considered to be passive structures that receive signals and do little else. It is now established that dendrites are significantly 
        more complex than originally thought. Furthermore, while it is thought that dendrites are good listeners, it was believed they did not have much to say, with the role of 
        chief communicator left to the opinionated and highly vocal axon that voiced (sometimes with a bit of modulation of presynaptic context) the opinion of the neuron. 
        Exceptions to this rule have been duly noted, but emphasized little.

            In and after class on Thursday 9/15, there was a fun discussion about retrograde firing of action potentials back towards the dendrites. 
            This discussion was started due to a diagram of a neuron that stated there were fewer voltage gated ion channels within the dendrite portion
            of a neuron, more voltage gated sodium channels around to the cell body, and finally more voltage gated calcium ion channels in the axon terminal
            of a neuron. This diagram is quite simplistic and probably meant for a basic generalization and understanding. <br><br>

            As this is a higher level course and because I, myself, just learned this after class by further "Google Scholar-ing" while eating a banh mi, it is worth noting that
            there is an abudance of literature suggesting that the dendritic membrane is "weakly" excitable compared with the somatic (cell body) membrane (Stuart et al. <i>Nature</i>, 1994,
            Magee et al. <i>Science</i> 1995, Magee et al. <i>J. Physiol. (Lond.)</i> 1995, etc.). At the same time, the three papers cited here also note that this is inconsistent with the
            comparable density of sodium and calcium ion channels within these two regions. Specifically, this literature looks at pyramidal cells in the neocortex as well as hippocampal pyramidal
            cells. Which voltage gated ion channels may then be responsible for reducing the likelihood of retrograde propagation of action potentials through the dendrites? What does this say about 
            the relative density of this particular type of voltage gated ion channels in the axon hilloc where the action potential begins to be amplified before passing down axon compared to its
            density closer to the dendrites?
        </span></li><br>
        <li><span>
            Recall our discussions on neurotransmitter release. It is more commonly discussed from the standpoint of vesicles containing neurotransmitters and being released into the synaptic cleft
            from the axon terminal of one neuron and then being picked up by the receptors within the dendrites of the post-synaptic neuron allowing for the influx of ions into the cell for excitation/inhibition.
            However, as we are <i>advanced</i> and like to dig into the weeds of the brain here in this class, it turns out that dendrites too can release neurotransmitters 😲! 

            As it turns out, dendritic release of neurotransmitters are extremely important in the olfactory system with similar calcium ion channel dependence. In particular glutamate is released from dendrites of certain
            cells. What might this release of neurotransmitters from the dendrites mediate as it may not be able to trigger a backpropagating action potential down the axon of the presynaptic neuron (i.e., where might it bind
            to on another neuron let ions flow inwards?)?
