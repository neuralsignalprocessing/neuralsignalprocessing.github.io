<h3>Problem 1</h3>

<div class="w3-padding w3-light-blue w3-display-container">
<h4>Distributed processing and organization of the brain (30 points)</h4>
<p class="w3-opacity">
    Begin by fully enjoying and admiring the artistry in writing, film, and animation in 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Q6qHRHTTPg" target="_blank">this clip</a>.
    Now, at the beginning of this clip the knights are skeptical of Donkey's neural development 
    of Broca's and Wernicke's areas as current research suggests that those areas have homologues 
    within animals of the <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/62797" target="_blank">non-human
    primate variety (macaques)</a> and not donkeys. Identify with both timestamps and explanations at 
    least one situational example in which somebeing (other than the old lady as she knows he's simply 
    refusing to talk) suspects that Donkey's brain is devoid of a Broca's area homologue <b>and</b> an 
    example of a Wernicke's area homologue with similar timestamp and explanation. (There are multiple within this clip).<br><br>

    E.g., The knights at the beginning (from about 35 seconds) clearly do not believe Donkey understands 
    what the lady is saying nor that he is capable of speech generation which puts into doubt whether or 
    not he has homologues of those areas. (In your answer be more specific of which brain area homologue
    and why you believe it to be the case. This is just a quick simple example that should not be used 
    as it is given).

    <li><span>Clear understanding of the functionalities of Broca's <b>and</b> Wernicke's areas (15 points)</span></li>
    <li><span>Creativity and critical thinking. There are multiple examples within this video that can be 
        argued for as diagnoses of Donkey either having problems with his homologues of these two brain
        regions or the lack of their existence within his brain, however, it requires understanding of

<h3>Problem 2</h3>

<div class="w3-padding w3-light-blue w3-display-container">
<h4>Membrane potentials, Nernst Equation, & GHK (50 points)</h4>
<p class="w3-opacity">
    Refer to PNS Chapter 7 for an explanation of the Nernst and Goldmann-Hodgkin-Katz equations. As discussed
    in lecture 4 on 9/6/22, a neuron's resting potential is determined by the relative intra- and extra-cellular
    ion concentrations and the corresponding conductivities of the respective ion channels. For a permeable
    membrane, if an equilibrium is established (i.e., by active transport) in which the concentration of an
    ion is different on either side but net passive flow of ions in and out is zero, an electrical potential
    (a voltage) will exist which represents the point at which the force of diffusion is balanced by electostatic
    forces. The Nernst equation gives the voltage as a function of the inside and outside concentrations.

    <ol type="a" class="w3-opacity">
        <li><span>
            Use the Nernst equation to fill in the equilibrium potentials for potassium, sodium, and chloride in 
            the table below.<br><br>
            <table>
                <tr>
                  <th>Ion</th>
                  <th>Extracellular Concentration</th>
                  <th>Intracellular Concentration</th>
                  <th>Permeability</th>
                  <th>Equilibrium Potential</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>K+</td>
                  <td>20 mM</td>
                  <td>400 mM</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Na+</td>
                    <td>440 mM</td>
                    <td>50 mM</td>
                    <td>0.04</td>
                    <td></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Cl-</td>
                    <td>560 mM</td>
                    <td>52 mM</td>
                    <td>0.45</td>
                    <td></td>
                </tr>
              </table><br>
              When the membrane is permeable to multiple ions, the equilibrium that is established is similar, 
              with the relative permeability for each ion determining its impact on the final membrane potential
              in addition to its external and internal concentrations. The Goldmann equation (or GHK) gives the
              equilbrium potential as a function of concentrations and relative permeabilities.
        <br><br></span></li>
        <li><span>
            Taking into account the potassium, sodium, and chloride concentrations, calculate the resting
            potential of a neuron with the characteristics in the table above.
        <br><br></span></li>
        <li><span>
            How could you adjust the potassium level to raise the resting potential? Why does this work?
        <br><br></span></li>
        <li><span>
            Calculate the new extracellular potassium concentration that would be needed to bring the resting
            membrane potential to -65 mV. To counteract the change in potassium concentration, the cell could
            insert or remove ion channels into the membrane thus changing the permiability ratios. Specifically,
            which ion channels would you propose the cell insert or remove in order to recover the original
            resting membrane potential? Calculate the new permeability ratios given your proposed change.
        <br><br></span></li>
        <li><span>
            It has been shown that there is an increase in extracellular potassium concentration within the rat
            hippocampus following concussive brain injury model. In general would the resting potential 
            of a neuron in this region be higher or lower given this change? What might this change do for a neurons 
            ability to fire an action potential assuming the threshold to required do so remains constant?
            <br><br>
            (BONUS)
            A common test for human concussion diagnoses during sports is eye tracking of an object and noticing the 
            rate/speed of eye movement in the tracking. Typically, the tracking is slower in individuals who have
            recently experienced a concussion. This implies that the assumptions made earlier
            are probably not safe to make in practice. One may hypothesize that it may take more time for a 
            neuron to reach the threshold to fire action potentials regardless of the resting potential, thus, impairing an 
            indivdual's eye tracking abilities. What change within the neuron may lead to this change? In other words, how 
            may the extracellular concentration of potassium have changed? Use the topics we've discussed in lectures and 
            reference PNS or Google Scholar as needed (but cite references outside of PNS).
